                        TemplateMonster produces responsive web design templates that each has 4 primary layout options and
                        a bunch of additional ones. So to accurately respond to the medium that is being used to view them,
                        the templates become fluid and easily adapt to the width of the browser. To degrade perfectly down
                        to smaller screen sizes responsive templates utilize changing font sizes, navigation menu, columns,
                        text blocks and images that scale and change their position. To see the responsive designs in action, 
                        please check out the templates' live demos and play with the browser window width.
